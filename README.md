### 🚀 About Me

My journey into tech began with a technical course in Information Technology at the *Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul – Campus Restinga*, where I built a strong foundation in software development.

Since then, I’ve been growing professionally through real-world projects, working both individually and collaboratively, always focused on writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices.
